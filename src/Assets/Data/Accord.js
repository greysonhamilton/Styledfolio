    "My name is Greyson Hamilton. I created my first website in 1995. I have been building websites, on and off, for over 20 years. I have built multiple sites for clients implementing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Creating applications that execute what the client wants to apply has always been fun for me. Solving problems and challenging myself helps me push myself even more. I enjoy learning and exploring new techology."
